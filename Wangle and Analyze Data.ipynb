    "The project on Data Wrangling was very intuitive and challenging and I gained valuable skills from working on this project. The steps required to complete project includes gathering the data from multiple data sources in different formats, assessing the data for quality and tidiness issues, and cleaning the data programmatically. The final step performed after cleaning the data was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis to generate valuable insights. "

Finally I have identified and documented several issues with data quality and tidiness which is listed as follows:"
